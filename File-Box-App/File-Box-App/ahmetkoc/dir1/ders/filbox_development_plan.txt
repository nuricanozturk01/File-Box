Requirements:

	Planned Architecure:
		Layered Architecture
		
	Planned Design Patterns: 
		microservice design pattern: API Gateway (Ocelot library)
		 why:
		 	1- Provide single endpoint for access the other microservices, so I can access only API Gateway on front-end part (like facade pattern)
			2- Creates an additional possible single point of failure
	
	Planned microservices:
		LoginService
		FileDownloadService
		FileUploadService
		FileDeleteService [If needed]
		FileCompressService [if we need zip both upload and download for folder]
		FileViewingService
